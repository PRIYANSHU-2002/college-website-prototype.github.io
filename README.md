This is a simple simulation of a college website for Computer Science department of our University. To land on the homepage of our website you first need to enter the login credentials (here you can enter anything or can even click on login button directly to enter the website as this is just a skeleton login page without any javascript embedded in it). Once you enter the home page of website, you are provided with a variety of options in the menu bar such as fee structure (where you can see semester wise fees and you can also pay your fees from there), faculty details, student registration form, about page, etc. This project is an individual project completed by me in the 4th semester of my course. This site is live at:
